Hi, I’m @nessdocs, a recent B.A. Technical & Professional Writing graduate.
I'm learning how to use DITA to create user guides. I'm also interested in learning how to write API documentation (definitely on the to-do list).

I love reading! I read mostly for entertainment, but will sometimes crack open a reference book or two. 
Other hobbies include watercolor painting, playing videos games (mostly RPGs both retro and modern), 
and working on modlists for Skyrim but never getting to play. 

Currently redoing my entire portfolio. Know any open source projects that need user documentation? Send me a message and I'll take a look. :D
